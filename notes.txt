Notes about executable (.sh) Linux files

1) create a new .sh file and add at the top the shebang line "#!/bin/bash"
2) after saving the file as <filename>.sh, enter the following command from the command line:
	chmod +x <filename>.sh
	NOTE: this will make the script executable
3) to actually execute the script, enter:
	./<filename>.sh


READ A FILE
1) get the content of a file as a string variable through the command:
	content=$(<<filename>)
2) display the file content by using:
	echo $content
	NOTE: you can refer to the file content using $<variable_name>
